	<h1> Who am I? </h1>
	<p> I am a 19 year old CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am pursuing a BS in CS with threads in information/internetworks and intelligence. </p>
	<h2> My Family </h2>
	<img src = "FamilyBDAY.jpg">
	<p> But I am also a son (to many degrees), a nephew, and a loved member of my family.</p>
	<img src= "Pure.jpg" width = "540" height = "770">
	<img src= "BabyCousin.jpg" width = "540" height = "770">
	<p> I'm a cousin to this beautiful girl who was such a light at such a young age (she's honestly too cute for a photo to capture). This is her waking up receiving a doll that I had bought her! This is honestly what I look like waking up as well, to be fair.</p>
	<img src = "Toby.jpg">
	<img src = "GradSister.jpg">
	<p> And this is my dog! Well, not really. His name's Toby and my cousins own him (but he's like my own dog). And on the right is my sister and I at my graduation. I guess a brother is yet another thing that I am. </p>
	<img src = "SandWalk.jpg">
	<p> But I'm a cool guy although I may not seem like it at first.</p>
	<img src = "HeartBeach.jpg">
	<p> And I am a lover (for all those who accept me and my silly love). </p>
	<img src = "FACEDEATH.jpg">
	<p> I would also face death and a lot of terrifying things for the ones I love (although I will refrain from saying everything in case I do chicken out from some things). </p>

	<img src = "HanBok.jpg">
	<p> But most of all, I am a friend. And I am only all the things above because of my friends who care so deeply for me. Because of them who've become a reflection of Christ in my life, I am able to push through all my struggles. </p>
