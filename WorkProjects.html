        I have worked as a software engineering Intern at Alarm.com during the summer of 2020. <br />
        I worked at Alarm.com as an intern for the commercial team. We dealt with issues and software that customers would deal with extensively.<br />
        For example, my project during the summer was to improve the reports and the report system at Alarm.com. This allowed dealers to make their own custom default reports that would be created on account creation according to what they wanted to show. <br />

        I have also worked on a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) at Georgia Tech. <br />
        The goal of this team was to see trends in the data of MOOC (massively open online courses) held at Georgia Tech and help students not give up on their courses. <br />
        We ran multiple models trying to guess what final grade they would end up and if they would even finish the course.<br />
        We then started to upload these models and the information we had in the form of infographics onto a web application that professors and students alike could access to enhance their online learning experience.

        A project I have worked on is a Discord bot in the summer of 2019. <br />
        This Discord bot would be able to take commands from a user to play music from youtube into a voice channel as well as other things like playing blackjack.

        Another project I worked on is using the PokeAPI in February 2021. <br />
        There is a particular discord bot that allows you to play pokemon in a server. One of the commands of this bot is to fish and allow you to guess what pokemon is on the line by giving you a string with some characters hidden. <br />
        I made an 'autofisher' in python that allows you to use the obscured string as an input an give you a list of pokemon it could be.

        A project that I worked on in the fall of 2020 was an ML project using traffic data. <br />
        We used unsupervised learning (feature extraction, feature selection, clustering, correlation matrices) in order to clean and get a better handle of the data. <br />
        We then ran multiple models with SVM, Random Forests, and Gaussian Naive Bayes models in order to find correlations and statements we could make about accidents that would include more than 1 car and those that would include only 1 car.
